## Problem Statement: Online Library System

Design and implement an online library system that allows users to borrow and return books. The system should consist of the following classes:

Book: A class to represent a book with attributes like title, author, ISBN, and availability status.

User: A class to represent library users with attributes like name, email, and a list of borrowed books.

Library: A class to represent the library itself, which manages books and user interactions. It should have methods to add books to the library, display the available books, allow users to borrow and return books, and provide a list of books borrowed by a user.

Main: A main program that simulates library operations like adding books, registering users, borrowing and returning books, and displaying information about books and users.
